.SYNOPSIS
    Clones a source folder to a destination using robocopy and verifies that files are identical.
    
.DESCRIPTION
    This script:
      - Accepts source and destination folder paths.
      - Creates the destination folder if it doesnâ€™t exist. If it exists, it warns the user and, upon confirmation, deletes it.
      - Uses robocopy (with /E and /COPYALL) to copy all files/subfolders while logging all operations both to the console and to a log file.
      - Verifies every file in the source by comparing SHA256 hashes with the corresponding file in the destination.
      - Creates a report that includes the robocopy log location and any verification issues (or a success message if everything matches).

.PARAMETER Source
    The folder to be cloned.

.PARAMETER Destination
    The folder where files will be copied to.
